# What is Zenon Network?
[Zenon Network](https://zenon.network) is a "self-evolving planetary-scale digital ecosystem powered by a worldwide community of contributors. Its fundamentally disruptive protocol goes beyond the blockchain trilemma. Zenon proposes a blockchain that is secure, scalable, and achieves true decentralization".

Zenon Network maintains a community run website at [https://zenon.network](https://zenon.network).  Other community members maintain informational websites about the project, such as [zenon.info](https://zenon.info) and [zenon.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4eF2YE3SJM).  
- `.info` is a community blog and should not be confused with Zenon Network.  
- `.org` is a venture backed entity that markets Zenon Network and develops closed source tooling for "performance marketing".

## Introduction
* This website serves as a roadmap for new users, contributors and developers to become familiar with Zenon Network. 
* Was Zenon designed by hardcore Bitcoin OGs? All signs point to YES, but DYOR.
* The founding developers and architects may or may not still be with us: DYOR.
* The community runs the project, in every respect.  We are autistic.  
* Moonboys beware.
* Jack is not going to save us, but if that interests you check out the [Moon Papers](https://znn.link/moonpapers).  They are autistic and probably wrong.    
* Expect to encounter developers and contributors who are not motivated by money or a localized pamp.  
* @Chadass (aka GigaWoke Capital) and his army of alts destroy the weak. Don't expect any sympathy.
* We are looking for contributors, developers, and speculators to join the community.  But before you do, always remember üëá

## üêá The Rabbit Hole üêá

### Step 1: Introduction Video 
Watch this üëâ [Zenon Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqAequz4mgk).  It will give you a high level outline of the project and its goals.  

### Step 2: [The Green Pill](https://medium.com/@Zyler9985/zenon-network-i-the-green-pill-883e608727a)

### Overview
Zenon Network is a new layer-1 cryptocurrency that launched its mainnet in November 2021. There are plans for apps, NFTs, interoperability, and DeFi with native Bitcoin. True decentralization is at its core, adhering closely to the Bitcoin ethos with an egalitarian launch‚Äîno presale, premine, VCs, or insider allocations, ensuring the same conditions for everyone through a public bond.

**Unique Tech:** Zenon innovates with a dual-ledger system: a meta-DAG for consensus and a block-lattice for storing transactions. It employs two native coins to achieve equilibrium and plans to implement [Narwhal and Tusk](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827.pdf) for extreme scalability, making transactions feeless*. Zenon is feeless at the layer-1 level, requiring only a simple proof of work to send and receive transactions. For higher throughput, users can lock QSR to generate ‚Äúplasma,‚Äù without spending QSR.

**Development:** Developers are building two Layer 2 solutions: one EVM compatible for interoperability and another with cutting-edge technology for extreme scalability. Smart contracts will be hosted on these Layer 2s to maintain a minimalist and efficient base layer.

**Anon Team:** The original core team remains anonymous, having passed the torch to the community, staying true to the Bitcoin ethos. There's speculation about Zenon's backing by OG Bitcoiners, but DYOR.

**Decentralization:** Zenon's principled adherence to decentralization through its egalitarian launch and grassroots marketing ensures the network is owned and controlled by the people, not institutions.

**Bitcoin Integration:** The network has ambitious plans for Bitcoin, leveraging the Taproot upgrade for new use-cases and aiming to integrate with Bitcoin via merged mining. This aligns with Zenon‚Äôs [whitepaper](https://znn.link/whitepaper), which envisions a hybrid of PoS and PoW.

**Native Coins:**
- **Zenon (ZNN):** Governance, 9M supply, 90M max supply
- **Quasar (QSR):** Gas*, 30M supply, 80M max supply

**Running a Node:**
- **Sentinel:** Requires 5k ZNN & 50k QSR
- **Pillar:** Requires 15k ZNN & 150k+ QSR

*Note: Feeless transactions on the base layer may still involve some costs or requirements, such as proof of work or QSR locking.
