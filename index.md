*Foreword:* Zenon Network is an Independent Entity
* Zenon was designed by hardcore Bitcoin OGs.  No, we don't know who they are so don't try to find them.  It's Impossible.  
* The founding developers and architects may or may not still be with us.
* The community runs the project now, in every respect.
* Moon boys beware. DYOR and don't expect $ZNN or $QSR to moon overnight.  Right now we are down only.  
* @Chadass and his army of alts destroy the weak. Don't expect any sympathy.
* We are looking for contributors, developers, and speculators to join the community.  But before you do, always remember this Zenon riddle. üëá
